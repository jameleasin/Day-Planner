This app uses Javascript and JSON to create a work day planner that allows the user to schedule plans in the textarea on their desired hour and save the plan so it will stay on the planners interface.
<br />
The planner is organised so that the past, present and future are displayed in different colours. Past being red, present being grey and future being green.
