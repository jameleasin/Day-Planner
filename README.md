This app uses Javascript and JSON to create a work day planner that allows the user to schedule plans in the textarea on their desired hour and save the plan so it will stay on the planners interface.
<br />
The planner is organised so that the past, present and future according to the current time are displayed in different colours. Past being red, present being grey and future being green.
<br />
This planner is easy to navigate with a save button next to every hours text area, which saves the users input to local storage, therefore saving it to the interface, making it easy for the user to visualise thier schedule for the working day.
